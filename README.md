# ShopSense-AI-Powered-Review-Insights

**ShopSense** is an AI-powered eCommerce platform built using **Django** that allows customers to submit product reviews after successful delivery. These reviews are analyzed using **Transformer models** to generate insights such as sentiment, intent, and scope type.
